# Jewish Liturgey Map - Sefaria Challenge

###<ins>About the project:</ins>
The Jewish Liturgey Map was made for the Sefaria 2020 challenge.
The challenge was to contribute to [Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org/), a digital libary for Jewish texts.
We decided to combine Sefaria's and the Google Maps's API to create a pictoral representation of when and where these texts were written.

##<ins>Technologies used:</ins>

- React
- Google Maps API
- Sefaria API

###<ins>How it works:</ins>
The Jewish Liturgey Map displays each text from the Sefaria digital libary on a Google Map React component as Google Map markers.
The marker is placed where the book was published. When scrolled over, each marker displays an info-box with data about the book it represents.
A silder component beneath the map allows the user to change the era the map depicts. The map then re-renders with the correct set of books.

##<ins>How to run locally:</ins>

- Clone the repo: CLONE LINK
- Change directory into the projects React folder: cd sefariachallengereact
- Run: npm install
